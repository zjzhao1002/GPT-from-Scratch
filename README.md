# GPT-from-Scratch
A small GPT language model is built from scratch by using PyTorch.
This model is developed by following [Andrej Karpathy's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY), 
but the tokenizer is replaced by the [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).
The input file contains some interview questions and answers for data science, which is collected from [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-science-interview-questions-and-answers/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/satishgunjal/data-science-interview-questions-answers).
